An all-in-one, locally-hosted, real-time quiz and event management platform designed for engaging live tech events. Built from the ground up in just two days by first-semester MCA students.

About The Project
"Kaun Banega Code Samrat" was born from the need to create a professional, TV-style quiz show experience for a college event, entirely offline and without any budget. The entire system is self-contained and runs on a single local machine, with dedicated browser windows for the audience display and the coordinator's control panel.

This project is a complete suite of tools for managing a live quiz from start to finish: from adding teams, controlling the game flow, to displaying scores in a beautiful, pictorial format. It was designed with a modern, engaging UI/UX to create a memorable and exciting experience for all participants.

Core Features
Real-Time Synchronization: A powerful Node.js + Socket.IO backend ensures that the Coordinator's Dashboard, the main Quiz Platform, and the Marks Chart are all perfectly in sync with zero latency.
Multi-Panel Interface:
Quiz Platform: The main screen for the audience, featuring dynamic animations, timers, and a live leaderboard.
Marking Dashboard: A comprehensive control panel for the event manager to control every aspect of the game.
Team Setup Panel: A user-friendly page for non-technical coordinators to add and manage teams before the event.
Live Marks Chart: A beautiful, pictorial, real-time bar chart that visualizes team scores, perfect for a secondary broadcast screen.
Thematic & Dynamic Rounds:
Round 1 (Rapid Fire): A fast-paced text and trivia round.
Round 2 (Visual Puzzles): An engaging round featuring image-based questions.
Engaging Game Mechanics:
Lifelines: Includes "50:50" and "Swap Question" to add a strategic layer to the game.
Full Timer Control: Dedicated controls for both a 30-second question timer (Start, Stop, Reset) and an automatic round timer.
Modern UI/UX:
A custom "Neon Night" color palette creates a vibrant, professional, and consistent aesthetic.
Integrated Animate.css library provides smooth, broadcast-quality animations for questions, answers, and transitions.
100% Offline Functionality: All libraries and assets (Chart.js, Animate.css) are hosted locally, requiring zero internet connection to run the event.
